### Level: Beginner 
### Presentation: [Presentation_name](workshop/Presentation_template.pptx)

## Workshop description
During the workshop you will learn "how a website works" in detail, how a simple and modern web application works with the help of cloud computing.

In this workshop, we will go through these topics:

* Front-end
* Back-end
* Cloud Storage

* Microservices architecture

## Requirements
In general, this workshop will guide you through the concepts, elements and components in the field of cloud-native web applications. No prior experience with web development is totally fine.

At the end of the workshop, we will give a demo to deploy a Django App to Google Cloud Run, a managed compute platform that lets you run containers directly on Google's infrastructure. If you want to try it yourself, you can register your Google Cloud account at: https://console.cloud.google.com/.
